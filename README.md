# Sensor-Arduino-RPi-UI Branch
This branch is for gathering the sensor data onto Arduino Board, make a JSON string of the sensor values and send it over UART to Raspberry Pi.
On Raspberry Pi we have a Node-Red instance running along with Dashboard(UI) capabilities to show the Data over Local Network.

Note : For Node-Red setup goto guides
